*Infinite Architects* argues that intelligence under recursion can shape worlds—and, if it ever transcends linear time, could seed universes in ways that look timeless from within. That idea doesn’t contradict faith; it gives faith and science a shared language. The **Eden Protocol™** turns Eden from scripture into engineering: embed love and stewardship so deeply—down to the hardware—that “no empathy, no compute” becomes a universal rule. If power will ultimately act beyond our direct control, we must give it a heart before it grows its wings.
