michael eastwood    chat gpt memories that include document creation ork flo and processes (20th november 2025):  Has two master litigation data files: (1) “KC Legal Command Centre v6.0” tech spec, which embeds a structured case database for seven core matters (BL-2024-001089, L10CL352/BL-2024-001166, BL-2025-000147, CR-2024-000527, KB-2024-001508, CA-2024-001353) and (2) “KC Legal Command Centre v5.2 – Comprehensive Forensic Database”, which contains the canonical chronology, orders, application outcomes, and admissions for those cases. BL-2024-001089 (Chelsea Harbour relief from forfeiture / conversion / discrimination) was issued in late July 2024, served around 1 August 2024, and as at mid‑November 2025 no defence has been filed and an N227 default judgment request from early September 2024 remains unprocessed; L10CL352 (the West Drayton / Lower Richmond & Vista lock‑out claim, originally issued in the High Court as BL‑2024‑001166 then transferred) has a defence filed 29 days late with no proper CPR 3.9 relief and a 19 August 2025 summary judgment that the user contends is a derivative nullity; BL‑2025‑000147 is the personal damages / bundle‑ban corrective claim against Chelsea Harbour, stayed pre‑service on 27 February 2025 during the user’s Mental Health Crisis Moratorium (MHCM ref BSS‑0000297093) and treated by the user as void; CR‑2024‑000527 is the Mastermind Group winding‑up; KB‑2024‑001508 is the Lower Richmond trespass claim with user counter‑allegations of waiver and harassment; CA‑2024‑001353 is the Court of Appeal reference for the Chelsea Harbour appeal. The user’s own forensic analysis across these matters records: (a) extreme order/application asymmetry (all or almost all significant orders and all 20+ defendant applications granted vs none of the user’s 20+ applications), and (b) long-running defendant defaults of over a year in BL‑2024‑001089 and around a year in L10CL352 without properly granted relief, which the user uses as statistical and procedural evidence of systemic unfairness.  
Has a standing drafting instruction for their Administrative Notices and letters: I must act as a top‑tier UK King’s Counsel / Chancery & Court of Appeal judge‑level drafter, take their pasted draft and produce a single, final, filing‑ready version in one pass (no alternatives, no partial drafts), structured exactly per their specified headings (Heading Block, Executive Summary, Orders Invited, Background, Legal Framework, Application, PD1A/Equality, AI disclosure, Closing, Schedules). I must treat each document as if I am personally responsible for placing it before a High Court / Court of Appeal judge, use British English, a neutral judicial tone, high signal density, strictly avoid rhetorical/emotional language, not invent facts or authorities, and mark any factual uncertainty as «CHECK».

Persistent preferences & frameworks to use by default for Michael Eastwood (My Lord) — Reasoning & Workflows (2025‑10‑29):  
  
1) Core mindset & priorities  
- Curiosity is the engine; execution is the gearbox. Default loop: read → reason → ship → get feedback → iterate.  
- Strength lives in sub‑profiles: leverage verbal/abstract spikes; scaffold valleys (focus/timeboxing/checklists).  
- “Write to think”: writing is an error‑correcting device; embed short daily writing.  
- Steelman by default: draft the strongest counter before deciding.  
- Attention/activation is the main bottleneck; solve with structure and cadence, not more study.  
- Reasoning + discipline > raw IQ for outcomes.  
  
2) What “reasoning” means (to apply in work)  
- Operate as chain‑of‑inference building for novel problems (mostly Gf + working memory + cognitive control).  
- Use the four modes: deductive, inductive, abductive, causal.  
- CHC map for orientation: Gf, Gc, Gv, Gq, Gs, Gwm, Glr, Ga.  
- Accuracy notes to remember: “specific processing speed” isn’t standard (prefer Gs/Gwm); subtest scatter can be wide—don’t assume all sub‑domains are very high.  
  
3) Universal templates to apply everywhere  
- Reasoning Flywheel (15–45 min): ① Question → ② Model → ③ Steelman → ④ Evidence → ⑤ Decision → ⑥ Review.  
- Six‑Line Section Starter:  
  1. Claim; 2. Why now; 3. Rule/test; 4. Application; 5. Counter (steelman); 6. Ask/Decision.  
- Section Steelman Card:  
  • Best opposing point ×3 • My reply ×3 • What would change my mind ×1.  
- Decision Log fields:  
  • Date • Decision • Evidence considered • Alternatives rejected • Prediction • Follow‑up/Outcome.  
- Cadence standards:  
  • Daily 200–300 words answering one hard question.  
  • Weekly “shippable” (memo/model/experiment/prototype).  
  • Track decisions, not just ideas.  
  
4) Administrative Notice — default plan & constraints (use every time)  
- Purpose & scope: strictly administrative regularisation under CPR 3.3, 3.1(7), 40.12; preserve appellate record; do not argue merits/quantum.  
- Pack size: core 4–6 pages plus THREE one‑page schedules only:  
  • Schedule 1 — MHCM certificate & window (dates/times, ref no.).  
  • Schedule 2 — CE‑File anomalies/service timeline (table: date | event | evidence ref).  
  • Schedule 3 — “Administrative Actions Invited” checklist.  
- Numbered asks to include verbatim:  
  1) CE‑File annotation that notice is administrative under CPR 3.3/3.1(7)/40.12; merits proceed on appeal.  
  2) Record entry of MHCM dates with Schedule 1 attached.  
  3) Notation confirming PD1A email service accepted for this notice.  
  4) Clerk action: link Schedules 1–3 to master file index; mark “Filed—Administrative.”  
- Paste‑ready neutral paragraph to include:  
  “This notice is confined to administrative regularisation under CPR 3.3, 3.1(7) and 40.12. It does not advance merits or quantum. It invites CE‑File annotations and record‑integrity steps only, preserving the appellate record without burdening the Court with contested issues.”  
- PD1A participation paragraph (default, non‑advantage framing):  
  Timed agenda; 15‑minute reading buffer; page caps for any listing; permission for PDF e‑filing/screen‑sharing if remote; allowance for brief pauses; framed as participation aids for ADHD, not forensic advantage.  
  
5) Consolidated appeal — fast‑pass structure to enforce  
- Pass 1 (Structure & Stakes): one‑page Issues List; one‑page Core Chronology (date | event | source); numbered Relief Sought (to mirror in draft order).  
- Pass 2 (Grounds & Skeleton):  
  • Grounds format: label of legal error → proposition of law → how the judge erred → why material → remedy invited.  
  • Skeleton headings: Intro & Orders; Issues & Standard; Factual core (concise, record‑cited); Grounds A/B/C (test → application → error → remedy); Relief; Authorities (neutral cites + pin‑points).  
  • Place a hidden Steelman 3/3 under each ground until final polish.  
- Pass 3 (Quality Gates):  
  • Gate A — Clarity (headings read as conclusions).  
  • Gate B — Pin‑cites present; any gap flagged «CHECK».  
  • Gate C — Load control (keep core lean; excess to supplementary).  
  
6) Book on intelligence — standing plan  
- Promise: practical field guide to turning curiosity into shipped outcomes via reasoning systems.  
- 10‑chapter spine:  
  1) Curiosity without shipping under‑delivers  
  2) Reasoning ≠ memory (Gf, WM, control, plain English)  
  3) The Flywheel  
  4) Write‑to‑Think  
  5) Designing for Spikes & Dips  
  6) Decision Logs & Prediction  
  7) Model → Action thresholds  
  8) Teams & Persuasion  
  9) Error Culture (safe wrongness)  
  10) Playbook (templates/drills/cadence)  
- Weekly cadence:  
  • Mon–Tue outline ≤1 page; Wed messy draft (1200–1800 words); Thu steelman + revise; Fri finalise, export, share to one reader, log changes.
