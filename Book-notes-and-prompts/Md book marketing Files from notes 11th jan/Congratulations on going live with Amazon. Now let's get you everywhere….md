**Priority order:** Apple Books first (largest non-Amazon ebook market, premium audience), then Kobo (strong internationally, especially UK and Canada), then Google Play (huge reach despite lower royalty), then Nook (US only, declining market share but still worth having).  
You can do all four today. By next week you'll be available everywhere books are sold digitally.
