# Submit a request to get full control of a business portfolio  
If you or your organization would like to have full control of a business portfolio that you claim ownership of, you can submit a request to Meta.  
Before submitting your request, try to contact the person who has full control of your portfolio and ask them to give you full control.

* No one has full control of the business portfolio.  
* The person with full control of the portfolio is deceased, and you can provide a death certificate.  
* You have a court order showing you’re the rightful owner of the business that the business portfolio belongs to.  
**Documents to include in your request**

* An acceptable form of identification of the person requesting access  
* A document that proves you own the business that the portfolio you’re requesting access to belongs to
