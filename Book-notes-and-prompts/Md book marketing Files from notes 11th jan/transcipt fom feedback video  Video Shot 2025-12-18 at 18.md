(0:00) Okay, this is what happens when we are opening it. (0:04) So we've got this, we've still got a lot of these old legacy components in the dashboard, (0:12) in the menu that might be useful to get rid of at one point. (0:17) But I'll click on this, and then it's running the script.  
  
(0:23) When it comes up, it takes it slow, it's quite slow, (0:28) so looking at speeding things up is another issue we need to resolve. (0:32) Now this weird thing comes up, I don't like that. (0:35) And it said, there's a Z in the initialization, (0:38) and also this comes up, which stays for a while, and then it goes.  
  
(0:44) And then now here, this comes up, this weird thing comes up here, I don't like that either. (0:49) And then it's got that see-through thing, which I don't know, (0:53) which I think is a notification, which nothing ever has shown on that before. (0:56) But the good thing is, it's opening now, and it's got all... (1:05) Okay, it's a bit jaggedy, can you see? (1:08) I'm pulling down, there's a bit of a lag, but it's not that bad.  
  
(1:14) There's a little bit of a flicker every now and then. (1:17) This wire here down the right, I don't know what this is, (1:20) where this, above the little robot, I don't know what that is, (1:24) and what it does, and what it's supposed to do. (1:26) I can't see anything on it, it could be good if it was working, (1:30) but at the moment, it's just a line down the screen, (1:33) so it just needs to be removed, or made to work, whatever it is.  
  
(1:39) Now on here, we've got this, and we've got all of the things. (1:44) So if we click on Manage the Templates, it should come up, but it's slow. (2:03) Okay, yep, there's nothing happening when I'm pressing Manage Templates, (2:06) so that's an issue that needs to resolve.  
  
(2:09) We've got these three here on the side. (2:12) All of these Bundle Generators, Schedule Manager, Clause Library, (2:16) Admin Notice is a bit of a repeat, N244 is a bit of a repeat, (2:22) Witness Statement is a bit of a repeat. (2:24) Can we simplify and put everything in here? (2:29) Somehow, Templates is a bit of a repeat because we added that, (2:33) so that could probably be removed.  
  
(2:36) We need to streamline this whole app. (2:40) But anyway, we need to get the bugs fixed first. (2:44) So now, okay, I'm going to click on one of these templates, (2:48) and show you what happens.  
  
(2:50) Now, for some reason, it says there's no sections there. (2:53) There should have already been pre-made template sections that we've created for these, (2:59) which should be their thing, but it's not. (3:01) Anyway, I'll click Admin Notice.  
  
(3:03) Weird thing comes up again. (3:05) Not sure what that is. (3:06) What's this black line down here? (3:09) How come Focus Mode has started and is on? (3:13) What's this Focus Mode bar doing there? (3:16) It's just a bit weird.  
  
(3:19) Do we need the Admin Notice section here? (3:22) Is it just taking up space? (3:24) There's all of this weird stuff here. (3:26) I can't click to make it full screen anymore because all of this is in the way, (3:31) in the top right-hand corner. (3:32) Anyway, we're on the document pipeline, which is on the Edit Document section, (3:40) which is the second section.  
  
(3:42) Now, we're here, and it's opening, which is great. (3:46) First time since the Ultra thing. (3:50) But now, if we look on here, it's just, all right, we've got Section 1 draft.  
  
(3:55) Okay, you can lock it. (3:56) Okay, good. (3:58) We've got Section 2 draft, okay, with locks and stuff.  
  
(4:00) All right, how come I can edit it if it's locked? (4:03) If it's locked, I shouldn't be able to edit it, yeah? (4:07) Okay, let's have a look. (4:09) Oh, maybe it wasn't locked. (4:11) Maybe that's just a lock sign.  
  
(4:12) So we just need to make it more obvious if it's locked or unlocked, (4:16) so I didn't know. (4:18) Okay, is that locked? (4:19) Okay, all errors coming up. (4:21) This buggy system here is coming.  
  
(4:23) Okay, and now, okay, all right, I've edited that. (4:26) Now, what's happened? (4:27) It's turned into 1. (4:29) Where were the three sections? (4:32) Where have they gone? (4:35) Where is all of that stuff? (4:37) How come I can still edit this? (4:38) I made it locked. (4:39) I locked it.  
  
(4:40) If it's locked, it shouldn't be able to edit it. (4:43) Yeah, you've got this. (4:44) You've got all of this.  
  
(4:46) Okay, you've got exhibits. (4:47) Okay, no exhibits. (4:47) Okay, drop-down box for exhibits.  
  
(4:49) Okay, good, good. (4:50) This is new. (4:50) This is new.  
  
(4:51) Authority. (4:52) So when we add in data, we can do that. (4:54) This is going off the page, the CPR bit.  
  
(4:55) I can't see that, but maybe it's because of this long line there. (5:00) Paragraph heading. (5:01) Okay, cool.  
  
(5:01) So we've got some settings now. (5:03) We can make it more formatable. (5:06) Subheading.  
  
(5:07) Okay, good, good. (5:10) Now, there is more different things here, which is good. (5:15) I like that.  
  
(5:16) You've got the editor split view, but now, again, this see-through panel's coming up again. (5:21) Now, this just looks a mess, too. (5:24) Yeah, okay.  
  
(5:25) So what we've got to go. (5:26) Okay, we've got the original version. (5:27) We've got the new version.  
  
(5:28) Okay, oh, all right. (5:29) So the split view is how it's supposed to look when it is in print. (5:41) So, okay, you've got that.  
  
(5:43) Okay, that's interesting. (5:45) But it's a bit buggy coming down. (5:48) Now, how am I supposed to add in another section? (5:50) I want to add another section here.  
  
(5:52) How do I add another section? (5:54) I can't add another section to the document. (5:56) So I've got a document. (5:57) I can only create one section, one paragraph for.  
  
(6:00) I can't add anything else. (6:01) The lock thing doesn't work. (6:03) Okay, I can preview.  
  
(6:04) Okay, all right. (6:05) We can see a little preview for the document. (6:07) That's good.  
  
(6:07) Go back there. (6:09) Yeah. (6:12) Now, what is this? (6:13) I don't know what this is.  
  
(6:15) Yeah, we can't have buttons and not know what it is. (6:18) Yeah, okay. (6:19) I don't know.  
  
(6:20) I could be deleting everything from that button. (6:23) I have no idea what it was. (6:25) Yeah, approve.  
  
(6:25) Okay, approve is good. (6:26) Selection approved. (6:27) But it already showed that it was approved before.  
  
(6:30) Yeah, okay. (6:31) And what's this one? (6:34) Numbers on or what? (6:35) I don't know. (6:36) I don't know what it is.  
  
(6:37) Okay, and this thing is coming up as well. (6:39) It's just so buggy. (6:40) It's so buggy.  
  
(6:41) How can we do this? (6:43) This is supposed to be the best editor ever created for legal documents. (6:47) You know what I mean? (6:48) At the moment, it's like for kids. (6:50) Kids can't even use it.  
  
(6:51) No one can use this. (6:52) Anyway, so we've got this there. (6:54) Okay, fair enough.  
  
(6:55) I haven't got any data in here in the system. (6:58) But when I have data, it's going to be okay. (6:59) All right, but I'm going to be able to add exhibits to this.  
  
(7:02) But I can't add them to actually see whether they're doing it, how they're doing it, you know, how it's going to go in. (7:08) Is it going to go nicely with text? (7:10) Is it going to come with a hyperlink, you know, or whatever and all of that stuff? (7:14) So I can't fully test everything until all of the data is in. (7:22) But I don't want to bring all of the data in when it's a mess, you know? (7:26) So this is a catch-22.  
  
(7:28) You know, what should I do? (7:29) Should I bring the data in and just try and work with the data in there already? (7:34) But, you know, I want to make sure that it's not going to go and mess up my data when I'm pressing things. (7:38) Because when I'm editing this, it's going like that. (7:39) And who knows what it's saving on top of, you know? (7:42) So it's like I have to bring it all in again anyway.  
  
(7:45) So what's this X do? (7:46) I don't know what that X does. (7:48) OK. (7:48) So this is just a mess.  
  
(7:49) This is a mess. (7:50) This is a mess. (7:50) OK.  
  
(7:51) We can do this. (7:52) What's this coach say? (7:53) OK. (7:53) Coach, no issues found.  
  
(7:55) No issues found. (7:57) Your writing looks great. (7:58) Have you seen my writing? (7:59) Have you seen it? (8:01) It's not.  
  
(8:01) That doesn't look great. (8:03) Yeah. (8:03) So obviously that's not working.  
  
(8:05) What's this AI suggestion? (8:12) Is that right? (8:15) I don't know. (8:18) Apply suggestion. (8:19) What does that do? (8:21) Oh.  
  
(8:22) So it's putting... (8:22) OK. (8:22) Apply suggestion is putting... (8:24) Again, it should be verified. (8:26) So it's putting actionable text about what I should potentially do into the document.  
  
(8:32) Yeah. (8:33) That's not right. (8:34) That's not right.  
  
(8:35) What is that? (8:36) What is that? (8:37) That's not good. (8:38) What is this? (8:39) OK. (8:39) We're going to press this button now as well.  
  
(8:42) Yeah. (8:43) What's happening? (8:44) This is supposed to be easy. (8:45) Add one document.  
  
(8:46) Click here. (8:47) Drag and drop. (8:48) We want drag and drop.  
  
(8:49) Up and down. (8:49) Up and down. (8:50) Click here.  
  
(8:51) Make it all good. (8:52) We want to go focus mode. (8:53) Oh.  
  
(8:53) We want to make it easier to work with. (8:55) OK. (8:55) Great.  
  
(8:56) Maybe we can get some more space like this. (8:58) I want to make it full screen. (8:59) How do I make it full screen? (9:01) I can't make it full screen at the moment.  
  
(9:02) OK. (9:03) All right. (9:03) It's a bit more space to work with now.  
  
(9:06) OK. (9:06) Good. (9:07) But I can't... (9:07) How do I add another? (9:10) The next section.  
  
(9:11) I can't add the next section. (9:18) There should be templates of the sections but also ability to add new sections and new (9:23) paragraphs and everything. (9:24) And then lock them as they're going along.  
  
(9:27) And that's the whole thing. (9:28) We can bring in sections that we've already written from facts and from authorities and (9:33) from grounds. (9:36) You know? (9:37) Where's grounds? (9:38) Grounds is not here.  
  
(9:40) You know? (9:40) Grounds is key. (9:41) Grounds is actually text. (9:42) that we can use to argue our point for all of the things.  
  
(9:47) It's one of the most important things. (9:48) We don't even have grounds as a link here. (9:51) You know? (9:51) OK.  
  
(9:51) All right. (9:52) We've got that. (9:53) OK.  
  
(9:54) All right. (9:54) Now we've got this. (9:55) OK.  
  
(9:55) All right. (9:55) A bit of a mess. (9:56) A bit of a mess.  
  
(9:57) OK. (9:59) Now... (10:00) OK. (10:00) All right.  
  
(10:00) All right. (10:01) Let's go to the next page. (10:03) OK.  
  
(10:03) Continue to generate. (10:04) Yeah? (10:05) All right. (10:05) How do we go to the... (10:06) How do we go full screen? (10:07) I want to go full screen.  
  
(10:08) OK. (10:08) I can't go full screen. (10:09) OK.  
  
(10:10) Let's not go full screen. (10:11) Let's just take this off. (10:13) OK.  
  
(10:15) All right. (10:16) Now we've got something. (10:17) OK.  
  
(10:18) I don't like this bright blue. (10:19) It looks amateurish. (10:20) Would a lawyer have this in a document? (10:22) Maybe we can have it in black.  
  
(10:24) Yeah? (10:26) Or really dark blue. (10:28) But not... (10:29) Not this colour. (10:31) Yeah? (10:31) Not this colour.  
  
(10:32) All right. (10:33) Now, I can't... (10:34) OK. (10:34) This one's sticking up.  
  
(10:35) I don't know how to get rid of this. (10:36) How does this go? (10:37) Yeah? (10:37) That's another bug there. (10:38) We've got all of this weird stuff in the corner still.  
  
(10:41) Yeah? (10:42) And now... (10:42) OK. (10:42) 100% facts. (10:43) OK.  
  
(10:43) Verified. (10:44) OK. (10:44) Well, have they? (10:45) There's none.  
  
(10:46) There's none in there. (10:48) There's none in there. (10:49) Oh.  
  
(10:50) Done. (10:50) Locked. (10:51) Locked.  
  
(10:51) Zero. (10:52) Done. (10:52) Approved.  
  
(10:53) Draft. (10:54) OK. (10:54) What's this? (10:55) Readiness.  
  
(10:55) Readiness. (10:56) Complete. (10:56) Loading completeness.  
  
(10:58) Quality score. (10:59) It's telling me that everything isn't so good. (11:03) How is this information coming up? (11:05) Why is it telling me I've got a precision of 100% when I've just written gibberish? (11:10) Yeah? (11:10) This is... (11:11) You know, this needs fixing.  
  
(11:13) Really. (11:13) Come on. (11:14) This is supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread.  
  
(11:17) This is going to be the best editing document for lawyers ever written. (11:21) Yeah? (11:22) Ever done. (11:23) Yeah? (11:23) Yeah? (11:24) Like it's going to solve all of their problems, apparently.  
  
(11:26) But not like this. (11:27) OK? (11:28) So you need that court bundle. (11:29) What's this? (11:30) All right.  
  
(11:30) You've got schedules. (11:32) Oh my God. (11:32) It's just... (11:33) Oh.  
  
(11:34) Edit schedule. (11:35) OK. (11:35) Let's edit schedule.  
  
(11:37) All right. (11:37) We've got edit schedule. (11:38) Where is the schedule to edit? (11:40) It's just all a mess.  
  
(11:42) Navigation. (11:43) Edit. (11:44) I can't edit anything.  
  
(11:46) I can't edit anything. (11:47) OK. (11:48) We want... (11:49) What's this? (11:50) Expand.  
  
(11:52) OK. (11:52) OK. (11:52) So we can see it.  
  
(11:53) We can see it. (11:54) We've got the draw thing behind there. (11:56) All right.  
  
(11:56) OK. (11:56) That's good. (11:57) That's good.  
  
(11:58) But... (11:58) All right. (11:59) What else? (12:00) OK. (12:00) Generate Google Doc.  
  
(12:01) Let's see. (12:02) Let's see if this actually happens. (12:04) Because it's not... (12:04) It's not happened for a long time.  
  
(12:06) It's not happened for a long time. (12:11) OK. (12:12) I don't even know what's going on.  
  
(12:13) I can't see the... (12:14) See any of the... (12:15) The toast notifications. (12:17) They're all a thing. (12:18) All right.  
  
(12:18) Generate PDF. (12:19) Let's have a look. (12:21) OK.  
  
(12:23) All right. (12:24) OK. (12:24) Generate PDF.  
  
(12:25) PDF's come. (12:26) I don't know where it is. (12:27) More notifications.  
  
(12:28) Nothing. (12:29) Nothing's showing. (12:30) Serve and lock.  
  
(12:31) All right. (12:32) What do you mean serve and lock? (12:33) All right. (12:34) Serve is when you've already served it.  
  
(12:37) And you're sending it to the core. (12:38) I can't serve. (12:40) So it doesn't make sense.  
  
(12:43) So you need to... (12:45) You need to change that and say served. (12:52) You know. (12:53) You need to say served or finalized or something served and locked in the vault.  
  
(13:00) This is a final document that's been served. (13:03) Yeah. (13:03) But like you can't... (13:04) At the moment I haven't got the opportunity to be able to serve it through here.  
  
(13:09) Through here. (13:10) Because it's not... (13:10) I haven't got a connection with the court. (13:13) So all of this stuff here and you go oh my god.  
  
(13:16) I can't even get to the full screen. (13:19) You know. (13:20) If I could get to the full screen maybe I could get more space.  
  
(13:22) This is supposed to be focus mode. (13:23) Why have I got all of this weird shit here in focus mode? (13:26) Focus mode is supposed to take away all of this stuff. (13:28) Yeah.  
  
(13:29) I don't want all of this stuff here. (13:30) Yeah. (13:31) OK.  
  
(13:31) Exit focus mode. (13:33) You know. (13:33) It's just... (13:36) You know.  
  
(13:36) It's like oh my god. (13:37) I've got ADHD. (13:38) I've got autism.  
  
(13:40) I've got all of this stuff. (13:41) And you know. (13:42) I'm... (13:42) You're trying to make... (13:43) I'm supposed to... (13:44) You're supposed to make my life easier.  
  
(13:46) And you're making it more difficult. (13:47) I might as well not even use this software. (13:49) I might as well go and use a document.  
  
(13:51) What's the point? (13:52) OK. (13:52) Let's go and see if it's going in here. (13:55) No.  
  
(13:55) Oh. (13:55) It's not going in. (13:57) It's not here.
