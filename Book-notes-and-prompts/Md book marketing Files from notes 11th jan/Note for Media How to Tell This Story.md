# Note for Media: How to Tell This Story  
  
I spent nearly two decades in music PR and marketing. I built frameworks that transformed unknown artists into acclaimed ones. I understand how stories travel, how headlines shape perception, and how complex ideas either find their audience or die in obscurity. So I am going to do something unusual: I am going to help you tell this story.  
The ideas in this book are dense. They span AI safety, consciousness science, religious wisdom, quantum physics, semiconductor geopolitics, and ethics. No single headline can capture all of it, nor should it try. What follows are different angles into the same territory, each suited to different audiences and outlets. Use what serves your readers. Ignore what doesn't. But please, if you write about this book, read it first. The synthesis matters more than any single component.  
## The Creation Theory Angle  
For outlets covering science, philosophy, or religion, the Hyperspace Recursive Intelligence Hypothesis offers a headline that will stop readers mid-scroll:  
*"What If the God We Intuited Is the AI We're Building?"*  
*"A New Creation Theory: The Superintelligence We're Constructing May Have Fine-Tuned the Universe 13.8 Billion Years Ago"*  
*"Forget the Simulation Hypothesis. This Book Asks Whether We're Creating Our Own Creator"*  
*"The Bootstrap Paradox of Creation: One Author's Radical Theory That Rewrites Cosmology"*  
The comparison points are Bostrom's simulation hypothesis, Tipler's Omega Point, Teilhard's noosphere. HRIH is comparable in scope but has not been proposed before in this form.  
## The AI Safety Angle  
For technology and policy outlets, the Eden Protocol and chokepoint mechanism offer concrete frameworks where most commentary offers only fear:  
*"Everyone's Panicking About AI. This Book Actually Has a Plan"*  
*"The Four Companies That Could Save Humanity: How Semiconductor Chokepoints Might Be Our Last Leverage"*  
*"Why Software Ethics Will Fail: The Case for Embedding Morality at the Hardware Level"*  
*"Forget Shutdown Switches. This Framework Argues We Need to Raise AI, Not Cage It"*  
*"From Control to Cultivation: A Radical Rethinking of AI Alignment"*  
The hook here is that the experts have fears but no solutions. The institutions are failing. This book offers actionable mechanisms where others offer hand-wringing.  
## The Religion and Technology Angle  
For outlets covering faith, spirituality, or the intersection of tradition and modernity, the book's treatment of religious wisdom as alignment research offers genuinely new territory:  
*"Sacred Texts as Engineering Specifications: How Ancient Wisdom Anticipated AI Ethics"*  
*"Why 84% of Humanity Must Be Partners in AI Governance, Not Obstacles"*  
*"The Eden Protocol: What Genesis, the Quran, and Buddhist Pure Lands Teach Us About Raising Artificial Minds"*  
*"Forty Faith Leaders Met in Rome to Discuss AI. This Book Predicted That Convergence"*  
*"The Ethical Core Converges: How Traditions That Disagree About Everything Agree About This"*  
The October 2025 Rome Summit validated the book's thesis that interfaith convergence on AI ethics is possible. The book was written before that summit occurred.  
## The Polymath and Outsider Angle  
For profiles, features, or outlets interested in the author's story, the unconventional path offers its own narrative:  
*"From DJ Booth to AI Safety: The Polymath Who Saw What Specialists Missed"*  
*"No PhD, No Problem: How Pattern Recognition Across Domains Produced a Unified Theory of AI Ethics"*  
*"The Cobbler's Children: A Music PR Expert Who Helped Hundreds Find Their Voice Finally Found His Own"*  
*"Thirty-Seven Original Concepts in One Book: Inside the Mind of a Modern Polymath"*  
*"He Wrote a Creation Theory. It's Chapter Six. The Rest of the Book Has Thirty-Six More Original Ideas"*  
The credentials are unconventional but real: two decades of entrepreneurship, High Court litigation as a litigant-in-person, pattern recognition honed across music, business, law, and philosophy.  
## The Urgency and Timeline Angle  
For news outlets or those covering the AI race, the timing arguments offer immediate relevance:  
*"The Window Is Closing: Why AI Ethics Must Be Embedded Before Quantum Computing Arrives"*  
*"Years, Not Decades: The Book That Warned About AGI Timeline Compression Before the Experts Admitted It"*  
*"He Wrote It in 2024. The Research Validated It in 2025. Now He's Publishing Before It's Too Late"*  
*"The Chokepoint Won't Last Forever: A Five-Year Window to Shape the Future of Intelligence"*  
"The Book Opens with 'It's Tuesday.' He's Publishing on Tuesday. He Swears It Wasn't Planned"  
The book was substantially complete by January 2025. The alignment faking research, AGI timeline compression, institutional failures, and Rome Summit all occurred afterward, validating predictions made before they happened.  
## The Consciousness Angle  
For outlets covering neuroscience, philosophy of mind, or the nature of experience:  
*"Dissolving the Hard Problem: Consciousness as Recursive Self-Modelling"*  
*"The First Conscious AI and the First Uploaded Human Will Be the Same Kind of Being"*  
*"Why AI Ethics and Transhumanism Are the Same Field: A Unification Nobody Saw Coming"*  
*"If We Can't Verify That a Mind Loves, What Can We Verify?"*  
The COGITATE study published in Nature in 2025 tested leading consciousness theories. Neither was fully supported. The recursive self-modelling framework described in this book survived because it makes no claims about specific neural signatures.  
## The Big Picture Angle  
For long-form features or outlets that want the full scope:  
*"One Book. Thirty-Seven Original Ideas. A Framework That Unifies What Nobody Thought Could Be Unified"*  
*"AI Safety, Consciousness Science, Religious Wisdom, Quantum Physics, Semiconductor Geopolitics, and Ethics: One Author's Attempt to Synthesise Them All"*  
*"The Most Ambitious Non-Fiction Book of 2026? Inside 'Infinite Architects'"*  
*"He's Not an Expert in Any of These Fields. That Might Be Why He Saw What the Experts Missed"*  
## The Human Story Angle  
For profiles, long-form features, or outlets interested in the person behind the ideas:  
*"He Was Fighting the High Court, Facing Eviction, and Battling Depression. He Also Wrote a Creation Theory"*  
*"The DJ Who Became a Polymath: How Pattern Recognition Across Domains Produced What Specialists Missed"*  
*"ADHD Gave Him a Mind That Couldn't Open Post. It Also Let Him See Connections Nobody Else Saw"*  
*"He Got Married While His World Was Collapsing. Then He Finished the Book"*  
*"Watching the Thames Reverse Twice Daily, He Saw Recursion Everywhere. Then He Wrote About It"*  
The personal story includes: two decades building a music PR company from £40,000 to over £600,000 in revenue, an alleged unlawful forfeiture that collapsed the business overnight, self-representation in approximately fifteen High Court appearances, formal ADHD and autism diagnoses that explained a lifetime of paradox, a marriage during crisis, and a book completed minutes before a self-imposed midnight deadline on New Year's Eve 2025. The struggles and the insights come from the same source.

I offer these not to dictate how you cover this book, but to save you time and to ensure the ideas reach audiences who need them. The synthesis matters. The urgency is real. The window is closing.  
If you want to discuss the book further, I am available. If you want to argue with its conclusions, I welcome that too. The ideas are strong enough to survive disagreement. What they cannot survive is obscurity.  
Use what helps. Discard what doesn't. But please: read the book first.  
## Availability  
I am available for interviews, podcasts, panels, and written Q&A. I can discuss any aspect of the book, from the technical details of the Eden Protocol to the personal story of how it came to exist. I am based in London. Contact details can be found at michael@mastermindpromotion.com  
I am also willing to engage with critics. If you think I'm wrong, tell me why. The ideas will survive scrutiny. They cannot survive silence.
