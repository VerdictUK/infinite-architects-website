**BBC NEWS TRANSCRIPT: Google Willow Quantum Computer Feature**  
**Broadcast: January 7, 2026**  **Reporter: Faisal Islam, Economics Editor** **Program: BBC News**  
  
**FULL TRANSCRIPT**  
**[Opening - News Anchor]**  
This is BBC News. Now, it's been described as one of the world's most advanced computers. And the BBC has got an exclusive look inside Google's **Willow**, a quantum computer, which is at the center of a battle between the world's biggest tech companies. It's a technology so advanced, it's creating a **race for economic supremacy between the US and China**. Our economics editor, Faisal Islam, went to Santa Barbara in California to take a look.  
  
**[Faisal Islam - Main Report]**  
This is one of the **most restricted, sensitive, and impactful inventions in the world**. What looks like a golden chandelier, containing technology that could **decide which countries and companies win the 21st century**. BBC News was invited to perhaps the most advanced quantum computer in the world, run by tech giant Google.  
**[Google Engineer]:** So the way this works is our Willow chip sits at the bottom of this cryostat right here. This is this place that's **freezing like nowhere else in the universe**.  
**Faisal:** Exactly.  
**[Engineer]:** **Colder than anywhere you'll find in the natural universe.**  
**Faisal:** All this only works at such cold temperatures, which they demonstrate by making plants crumble in liquid nitrogen, because this quantum computer uses the **frontiers of physics** to harness the ability to do **incredible amounts of calculations**.  
**[Engineer]:** Last year, we had this result that showed that our Willow chip could do a computation that **would take much longer than the age of the universe** for even the world's best supercomputers that we have. And so we call that problem **impossible for a classical computer**.  
  
**[Interview with Hartmut Neven - Google Quantum AI Lab]**  
**Faisal:** Hartmut Neven leads the Quantum AI Lab. Members of his team have just received the **Nobel Prize**. He sees this Willow quantum chip transforming medicine's discovery, helping with limitless fusion energy, and even supporting solving climate change sooner than you might think.  
**Hartmut Neven:** Think of **batteries that are so light that you could have electric airplanes**, not just electric cars. This would solve many important problems humankind has.  
**Faisal:** How long is it going to take for this experimental chip to actually be widely applied in the solutions to the problems you described?  
**Hartmut Neven:** So to really lodge...  
**Faisal:** Decades?  
**Hartmut Neven:** No, I think it's sooner. So we think to lodge this technology in day-to-day practice, **for example, for drug discovery, it's probably within the next five years**.  
  
**[Geopolitical Context]**  
**Faisal:** Quantum computing could be the **new Manhattan project**, with the world's biggest companies and biggest countries competing hard to produce the world's most powerful functional quantum computer. And in and of itself, it's transforming science. Whoever gets their hands on that powerful quantum computer will also **transform every other branch of research too**.  
  
**[Sir Peter Knight - UK Quantum Expert]**  
And one of the UK leaders in the field points out what's up for grabs for the winners in this new quantum world.  
**Sir Peter Knight:** The total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of **all the rest of the world's government programs put together**. It could include the eventual power to **decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin**. You see when you look at a secure site, a little padlock appears on your browser window, okay? Our quantum computer will **undermine that completely and utterly**. All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat.  
  
**[Multiverse Connection - Hartmut Neven]**  
**Faisal:** And Professor Neven believes it does raise credible questions about **what exists beyond this universe**.  
**Hartmut Neven:** We should be careful to say that by no means do these computations and their exponential advantage relative to classical computers **prove that parallel worlds or many worlds exist**. But they are very—but it's **very suggestive that we should take this idea serious**.  
  
**[Closing]**  
**Faisal:** The government's planning to pour money into British quantum research very soon. **It all sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact**. Faisal Islam, BBC News in California.  
  
**[Studio Discussion - Anchor & Faisal Islam]**  
**Anchor:** And Faisal is with me here. Faisal, that is **mind bending stuff**. We're going to get into the implications in just a moment. But do you want—can I ask an unfair question? Do you want to have a go at explaining **how does this actually work**?  
**Faisal:** Okay, so a conventional classical computer—it's about **bits**. So it's binary, so zero or one. Those are the gates in the chips and you can actually physically observe them. A quantum computer harnesses the world of **quantum mechanics**—and try and explain that simply, although I think you need a PhD even for Quantum 101. There's some **uncertainty about the state at any one time** and even **observing the state of a quantum computer changes it**. It's just **highly existential**, but it basically means you **harness the power of the exponential**.  
And I think the more simple way to explain it is you imagine, like, a hundred drawers and there's a tennis ball in one of them. A classical computer you'd have to open each one in sequence and you'd find one and it would take time. **A quantum computer kind of automatically—you just open all the drawers and you know exactly what's in all of them at the same time**.  
So that's it. It's **very error prone**. They refer to this being like toy model stage. These things are more powerful. The sort of key future thing that Google did at that lab that I saw was they started **correcting for some of the errors** that you get. So they started to have **proof of concept that you could do this at scale**. And as I said, there's a big competition between the big US tech firms and between various countries about who gets these **extremely powerful keys to unlock not just the future of computing, but the future of economy, military superiority, the whole shebang**.  
  
**Anchor:** And what was it like when being there? Did you get the feeling that this is hugely consequential?  
**Faisal:** Well, it did from the sort of **highly restricted nature** of it. You know, it's like Skynet from the Terminator movies. You go in there and sign your life away, going to point the camera in certain directions. But when I saw it, it was quite surprising. It was like something quite **old school, 1980s**. There's something, you know, a little bit like the expert you saw in there, Sir Peter Knight, the British expert, referring to it as a little bit like **going to see Colossus**, the computer at Bletchley Park that helped break all those codes.  
These won't be computers that we have in our pockets or in laptops. I mean, I say that now. Famously, and they referred to that whilst I was there, the IBM executive in the 1940s said, **there'll only need to be two or three computers in the whole world**. And obviously we know that's untrue. But the **sheer power** of this, and I think the key thing to understand the science here is that it **mimics natural systems, quantum systems**. And so you wouldn't use this for everyday compute, but you would use it to **model molecules, you'd use it to model nuclear fusion**. And I think that is the key use case here. It's quite the training data. And indeed **some argue you won't get true artificial intelligence until you get quantum—the exponential power of quantum computer behind it**. This is just one method, by the way. There's various other scientific methods which are being pursued by other companies and other countries.  
  
**Anchor:** And just let's get on to the implications then, the geopolitics. There is a race presumably by countries, companies to harness this and whoever wins is in a hugely advantageous...  
**Faisal:** So you know, the big two are obviously **US and China**. The US model is clearly very **commercial**. You're seeing competition between the big US tech companies to try and win. They're using different methods. And then you have China, which did have some of that with the likes of Alibaba and others. That's been **consolidated as a state effort in China**. And I think as you heard there from Sir Peter Knight, they are now **spending more as a nation in China than any other governmental project around the world**.  
UK, actually here in the UK, we have some of the pioneering science in this area. One of the Nobel Prizes was won for what we call **superconducting qubits**. That's the technology behind Willow. That was developed originally by a British scientist. And there will be a **big push in the UK** behind the UK's role in quantum.  
But the consequences are highly significant. Now, there's this thing called **"harvest and decrypt"**. Just imagine this. So companies, banking systems, perhaps some intelligence agencies have worked out at some point in the future when these computers become operational, you'll be able to **decrypt anything, everything**. All the financial services records, Bitcoin, your emails. So they're **harvesting data that is currently encrypted** with the knowledge that in **10 or 20 years time** their successors will be able to decrypt it. You know, it's quite sobering to think of the **sheer power** of all of this when they get a functioning model, which they say there could just be **five years away**.  
**Anchor:** Faisal, thank you so much for that. Absolutely fascinating.
