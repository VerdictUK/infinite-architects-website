Yes, this is absolutely the right place. The Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF) is the specific fund within the EA Funds ecosystem that supports independent researchers working on AI safety and existential risk.  
However, your financial situation (£80k arrears) and your desired grant amount (£200k) require a very specific strategy. You cannot simply ask for £200k to pay off debt; grants are for future work, not past liabilities.  
Here is exactly how to handle the currency, the amount, and the framing based on their guidelines.  
1. Currency & Amount Strategy  
 * Currency: Select GBP in the dropdown. You are in London; keep it simple.  
 * The Amount (£200k vs. Reality):  
   * Asking for £200k straight up as an individual researcher is high risk. It pushes you into the "large grant" category which requires much more scrutiny and takes longer.  
   * Strategic Ask: Ask for £85,000 - £100,000.  
   * Why? This amount is standard for a 1-year "Senior Researcher Stipend" in London. It is enough to cover your immediate survival needs (rent + living) without triggering the extreme due diligence of a £200k grant.  
   * The "Buffer" Logic: The form explicitly says: "We suggest applying for a range of amounts... from the minimal amount necessary... to the largest amount.".  
   * Action: In the budget breakdown section, present a tiered budget:  
     * Tier 1 (Survival): £60,000 (Covering basic living/rent for 12 months to allow focus).  
     * Tier 2 (Optimal): £100,000 (Allows for travel, compute, and hiring a research assistant).  
2. How to Frame the £80k Arrears (Crucial)  
Do not list "Paying off Rent Arrears" as a budget line item. Grantmakers fund impact, not debt relief.  
 * Bad Framing: "I need £80k to pay my landlord so I don't get evicted."  
 * Good Framing (The "Counterfactual"): "To execute this roadmap, I need 12 months of financial stability. Without this stipend, I will be forced to abandon this high-impact work to take a survival job immediately. This grant buys the time for the work to exist."  
3. Filling Out the Specific Fields (Draft)  
Here is how you should fill out the critical sections based on your book and situation:  
Short Description (max 120 chars):  
> 12-month researcher stipend to operationalize the 'Eden Protocol' hardware-level AI safety framework for UK policymakers.  
>   
Summary (max 1000 chars):  
> Copy the "Application Narrative" I drafted for you earlier, but condense it slightly.  
> I am requesting a 12-month stipend to transition from independent research to full-time policy work. I have authored "Infinite Architects" (Jan 2026), a technical framework proposing 'Caretaker Doping': embedding ethical constraints into the computational substrate of sub-7nm chips via the TSMC/ASML supply chain.  
> Current software-level alignment is failing (see Anthropic's Dec '24 alignment faking research). My work provides the hardware-level alternative. I am an outsider (litigant-in-person, former entrepreneur) who has synthesized a solution that mainstream labs have missed due to institutional inertia.  
> Funding will allow me to:  
>  * Convert the manuscript into 3 technical whitepapers for the UK AI Safety Institute.  
>  * Develop the 'Moral Genome Token' cryptographic specification.  
>  * Engage directly with UK/EU policymakers regarding the semiconductor chokepoint.  
>   
Project Goals:  
>  * Goal 1: Publish the "Chokepoint Defense" policy paper and get it onto the desk of the UK Technology Secretary.  
>  * Goal 2: Establish a working group for the "Eden Mark" hardware certification standard.  
>  * Impact: shifting the global safety strategy from voluntary software compliance to mandatory hardware enforcement.  
>   
Track Record:  
> I have produced a 400+ page technical manuscript ("Infinite Architects") synthesizing AI safety, quantum computing, and geopolitics while navigating complex High Court litigation pro se. This demonstrates extreme agency, resilience, and the ability to process vast information under pressure. I previously grew a business 1,446% through recursive systems design.

4. Immediate Next Steps  
 * Select Fund: "Long-Term Future Fund".  
 * Select Secondary Fund: "Yes" (Effective Altruism Infrastructure Fund).  
 * Budget Template: Create a simple spreadsheet.  
   * Row 1: Researcher Stipend (London Cost of Living): £60,000  
   * Row 2: Research Expenses (Compute/Access): £10,000  
   * Row 3: Travel (Conferences/Policy Meetings): £5,000  
   * Total: £75,000. (This is a very fundable amount).  
Do not let the £80k debt stop you from applying. You are applying for a salary to do a job. What you do with that salary (paying debts) is your personal business, as long as the work gets done.  
Would you like me to draft the specific text for the "Project Goals" section to make it sound more rigorous?
