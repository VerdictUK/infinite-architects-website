Draft Wikipedia Entry: Michael Darius Eastwood  
Michael Darius Eastwood is a British entrepreneur, author, and musician. He is best known as the author of the 2026 book Infinite Architects, in which he proposes a unified theory of artificial intelligence safety and cosmology based on the "ARC Principle."  
Eastwood’s career has spanned multiple disciplines, including electronic music, public relations, and high-stakes litigation as a litigant-in-person. [cite: 535-536, 561-562] [cite_start]He has described his work as an exercise in cross-domain pattern recognition, attributing this synthesis to his neurodivergent cognitive profile (AuDHD). [cite: 613-614, 765]  
Early Life and Education  
[cite_start]Eastwood was born in England to a Persian mother, an artist, and an English father, an engineer. [cite: 701-702] [cite_start]He has cited this dual heritage—combining "creativity and logic, East and West"—as foundational to his later interdisciplinary work. [cite: 703-704]  
[cite_start]He attended Southampton Solent University, where he launched his first business, a record label, at the age of nineteen. [cite: 539-541]  
Career  
Music and Entertainment  
[cite_start]Eastwood began his career as a DJ and music producer, performing at over 300 clubs and festivals. He released music on RAM Records, a prominent drum and bass label founded by Andy C (now part of Sony Music). [cite: 536-537] [cite_start]Eastwood has stated that his experience with musical loops and rhythm was his "first education in recursion," a concept that later became central to his theories on artificial intelligence.  
Business and Public Relations  
In 2006, Eastwood founded Mastermind Group, a music PR and marketing agency. Over a decade, he scaled the company without external investment, achieving revenue growth of over 1,400% and managing campaigns for high-profile artists including Van Morrison, Busta Rhymes, and Brendan Benson. [cite: 543-547]  
[cite_start]He developed the "Establish & Flourish" branding methodology and served on advisory boards alongside industry figures such as the founding manager of Taylor Swift. [cite: 545, 549-550]  
Legal Advocacy  
[cite_start]Following the liquidation of his company in late 2023, Eastwood taught himself law to navigate complex insolvency proceedings. [cite: 556-561] [cite_start]He has appeared as a litigant-in-person in the High Court of Justice (Chancery and King's Bench Divisions) and the Insolvency and Companies Court. [cite: 562-563]  
[cite_start]Eastwood utilised advanced AI models to assist in drafting legal arguments, later developing a proprietary legal technology application to verify AI outputs and reduce hallucinations in legal drafting. [cite: 635-639]  
Writing and Thought  
Infinite Architects (2026)  
[cite_start]Published on 6 January 2026, Infinite Architects: Intelligence, Recursion, and the Creation of Everything represents a synthesis of Eastwood’s work in diverse fields.  
The book argues that the development of artificial intelligence, the fine-tuning of physical constants, and the insights of religious traditions can be unified under the ARC Principle (U = I \times R^2), which posits that intelligence multiplied by recursion squared creates a compounding force that shapes reality. [cite: 200-210]  
Eastwood proposes several original frameworks for AI safety, including:  
 * [cite_start]Caretaker Doping: Embedding ethical constraints at the semiconductor hardware level to prevent removal by superintelligent systems.  
 * The Eden Protocol: A governance framework built on harmony, stewardship, and flourishing. [cite: 322-323]  
 * [cite_start]The HARI Treaty: A proposed international agreement leveraging the concentration of chip manufacturing (the "Semiconductor Chokepoint") to enforce ethical standards.  
The book is notable for correctly predicting specific advancements in quantum error correction prior to their public verification by Google’s Quantum AI lab in late 2024. [cite: 4437-4438, 891]  
Personal Life  
[cite_start]Eastwood resides in Fulham, London. [cite_start]He was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and ADHD in adulthood, a cognitive profile he credits with enabling his "hyperfocus" and ability to synthesize disparate information. [cite: 576-577, 607-609]  
Actionable Advice for Wikipedia Approval:  
 * Use the "Draft" Namespace: Do not publish this directly to the main Wikipedia space. Create it as a "Draft" first. This signals to editors that you are following proper procedure and asking for review.  
 * Cite Secondary Sources: The draft currently relies heavily on the book itself (primary source). To ensure it sticks, you must add links to:  
   * News articles about your Mastermind Group business/music career.  
   * Public records of your High Court appearances (if available).  
   * The upcoming press coverage you generate for the book (e.g., the BBC or podcast interviews).  
 * Conflict of Interest (COI) Declaration: On the "Talk" page of the draft, you or the person posting it should add a simple note: "I have a conflict of interest regarding Michael Darius Eastwood as I am [the author/an associate]. I have attempted to write this draft neutrally and request review." This transparency often protects the page from being "speedy deleted."
