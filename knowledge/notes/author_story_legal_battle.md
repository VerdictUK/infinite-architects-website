# Note: The Author's Story — From the High Court to the Cosmic Orchard

Michael Darius Eastwood's journey to writing *Infinite Architects* was forged in the "crucible" of personal crisis and neurodivergent insight.

## The Legal Battle
In late 2023, Michael's music PR business (which he built over a decade to £600k+ annual revenue) collapsed overnight due to an alleged unlawful forfeiture of his premises. Padlocked doors led to a 99.1% revenue drop and the loss of his intellectual property.

Facing eviction and clinical depression, Michael taught himself law and represented himself as a **litigant-in-person** in approximately fifteen High Court appearances across various divisions (Chancery, King's Bench, Insolvency).

## The AuDHD Insight
Diagnosed with **ADHD and Autism (AuDHD)**, Michael realized his brain works recursively rather than linearly. While he struggled with the linear administrative procedures of the law (opening post, meeting deadlines), he excelled at the recursive structure of legal argument—where one principle established in 1876 cascades through a century of case law.

## Pattern Recognition
His unique cognitive signature allowed him to see the same recursive patterns across disparate domains:
*   **Music:** Repetition and variation in drum and bass.
*   **Business:** Systems that scale and compound.
*   **Law:** Precedents building on precedents.
*   **Science:** Quantum error correction and cosmic fine-tuning.

## The Book's Origin
*Infinite Architects* was completed minutes before a self-imposed midnight deadline on New Year's Eve 2025. It was written while Michael was qualifying for a mental health crisis moratorium to pause eviction proceedings. The book's thesis—that care must be load-bearing—is not just a theory for him; it is a practiced resilience.

**Conclusion:** The struggle and the insight come from the same source. Michael's neurodivergence is his "edge," allowing him to synthesize a framework that bridges AI safety, religious wisdom, and cosmology.
