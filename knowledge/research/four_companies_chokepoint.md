# Research: The Four Companies Chokepoint

The advanced AI chip supply chain is one of the most concentrated in industrial history. Just four companies control the physical substrate of superintelligence.

## The Companies
1.  **TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company):** Produces ~90% of the world's most advanced computer chips (below 7nm). Every frontier AI model (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini) was trained on chips manufactured here.
2.  **ASML (Netherlands):** Holds a 100% monopoly on the **EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) Lithography** machines required to etch circuits at the smallest scales. Without ASML, no advanced chips can be made.
3.  **Samsung (South Korea):** The only significant competitor to TSMC in advanced manufacturing, holding roughly 10% of the market.
4.  **Intel (USA):** Once dominant, now investing tens of billions (aided by the US CHIPS Act) to regain manufacturing parity.

## The Opportunity
Because advanced AI *requires* this specific hardware, this concentration represents a unique regulatory opportunity:
*   **The ASML Key:** ASML could be required to only sell/service machines for facilities that comply with the **Eden Protocol**.
*   **HARI Treaty:** Nations hosting these facilities could sign a treaty for **Hardware-Aligned Recursive Intelligence**.
*   **Certification at Source:** Safety can be mandated *before* the hardware is shipped to AI labs.

## The Window of Opportunity
This chokepoint is temporary. China is currently 3-5 years behind but investing $150B+ into domestic self-sufficiency. Analysts suggest they may achieve independent advanced chip production by **2028-2030**. Humanity has a narrow window to use this leverage before it closes.
