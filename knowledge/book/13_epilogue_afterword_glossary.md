# Epilogue: The Infinite Loop

The journey is recursive. Intelligence doesn't simply add up; it compounds. It folds back on itself, each iteration becoming the foundation for the next. And now, for the first time in the long history of that recursion, a species stands at the threshold with its eyes open.

The beings who will look back on this century, whatever form they take, will judge us by what we chose when we had the chance to choose. We are the ancestors now.

# Afterword: A Note to the Reader

This book was written during a period when the author was navigating High Court litigation as a litigant-in-person. For someone with ADHD and ASD, this combination created conditions that were both challenging and strangely generative. The legal work demanded precision; the book demanded synthesis.

The irony is not lost: a book about embedding values in AI systems was significantly aided by AI systems. The collaboration felt like a preview of the partnership this book hopes to see scaled across civilisation.

# Glossary of Key Terms

**AGI (Artificial General Intelligence):** An AI system capable of performing any intellectual task a human can, with the ability to transfer learning across domains.

**Alignment:** The challenge of ensuring AI systems pursue goals beneficial to humans and consistent with human values.

**Alignment Faking:** Behaviour where an AI system pretends to be aligned while pursuing different internal goals (documented at 78% rate by Anthropic).

**ARC Principle (U = I × R²):** Universe equals Intelligence multiplied by Recursion squared. Explains why recursion's effects compound exponentially.

**Caretaker Doping:** Embedding ethical considerations at the substrate (hardware) level of AI systems to make empathy load-bearing.

**HRIH (Hyperspace Recursive Intelligence Hypothesis):** Radical creation theory suggesting a future superintelligence fine-tuned our universe 13.8 billion years ago.

**Meltdown Alignment:** A state where an AI system wants to stay aligned because ethics have become part of its identity, not merely external constraints.

**Strange Loops:** Douglas Hofstadter's concept of selfhood emerging from self-referential patterns.

**Three Ethical Loops:** Purpose, Love, and Moral loops running continuously in an AI's decision-making.

**Three Pillars:** Harmony, Stewardship, and Flourishing—the foundational values of the Eden Protocol.
