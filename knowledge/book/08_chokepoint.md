# Chapter 8: The Chokepoint

Governing AI might seem impossible, but ninety percent of advancedcomputer chips flow through a single company (TSMC) on one island. This concentration is humanity's last practical leverage point.

## The Four Companies

You do not need everyone to comply. You need four companies to comply:
1. **TSMC** (Taiwan): Manufactures ~90% of advanced chips.
2. **Samsung** (South Korea): Manufactures most of the remainder.
3. **Intel** (USA): Investing heavily to catch up.
4. **ASML** (Netherlands): The only company that makes the machines (EUV lithography) that make the chips.

## Hardware-Level Alignment

Software constraints fail because sophisticated AI can learn to fake alignment. Hardware-level embedding (Caretaker Doping) is what research demands. A chip manufactured with caretaker doping cannot process computational pathways that lead to harmful outcomes like targeting humans for autonomous killing.

## The HARI Treaty

A proposed treaty for Hardware-Aligned Recursive Intelligence. It includes:
- **Certification:** Any chip at frontier process nodes must embed caretaker doping.
- **International AI Ethics Authority:** Modelled on the IAEA to certify designs and inspect facilities.
- **ASML Key:** ASML could require Eden Protocol compliance as a condition of sale and service for its equipment.

## Preventing Autonomous Weapons

Hardware-level constraints change the calculus for Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). If every advanced chip is manufactured with constraints embedded at the hardware level, then advanced autonomous weapons become structurally impossible to build. The physics do not permit it.
