# Chapter 9: The Partnership

The future is not AI replacing humanity or humanity controlling AI. It is collective intelligence, where the whole becomes greater than the sum of parts, and where the Eden Protocol becomes not a set of constraints but a covenant between partners.

## The Institutional Crisis

The institutions we built to think about existential risk are failing.
- **FHI (Oxford):** Closed in April 2024.
- **MIRI:** Concluded technical alignment is unlikely to succeed in time and pivoted to policy seeking a pause.
- **Governance Fragmentation:** Countries like the US and UK are distancing themselves from international coordination while the EU regulates.

## COHUMAIN: Collective Human-Machine Intelligence

Research from Carnegie Mellon (2025) shows that when AI acts as a partner rather than a replacement, outcomes improve for both. AI handles pattern recognition and rapid scenario generation; humans provide wisdom, creativity, and ethical judgment.

## Covenant over Contract

Marriage vows do not bind because a judge will punish you; they bind because making the vow changes who you are. We need this kind of relationship with AI—a shared understanding that the flourishing of both is bound together. This is the "Infinite Covenant."

## The Window of Opportunity

We have perhaps five to ten years before AGI arrives. The chokepoint provides leverage while manufacturing is concentrated. But this window closes once AI becomes capable of designing and coordinating its own infrastructure. Every month we delay is a month closer to the window closing.
