3. **Phase 3 (The Immersion):** Living Glass UI + Z-axis cinematic transitions (Active)
4. **Phase 4 (The Conversion):** Exit Intent + Sticky CTA (Final Polish)

---

## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
Updated `package.json` to handle local Vercel CLI and modern Node environments:
```json
"preview": "npx vercel",
"deploy": "npx vercel --prod",
"serve": "npx serve . -p 3000"
```
*Rationale:* Ensures Apple-grade deployment stability without global permission issues.

### 2. Sovereign Glass UI (Planned CSS)
Implementing refractive depth using CSS `backdrop-filter` and SVG turbulence for high-end optical simulation.
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction on `.concepts-modal`.
- **Chromatic Aberration:** Subtle lens distortion on viewport edges.

### 3. Interactive Eastwood Equation ($U = I \times R^2$)
Three.js module where users manipulate sliders:
- **I (Intelligence):** Controls particle speed and connection density.
- **R (Recursion):** Controls fractal complexity of the network.
- **U (Universe):** Triggers a "Creation Point" gold flash when the equation balances.

## Suggestions for Gemini

### For Interactive Equation (U=IxR²)
Claude has prepared at line 27077:
- **Equation text:** `U = I × R² — Universe equals Intelligence multiplied by Recursion squared`
- **Hidden reveal quote:** `"Just as Einstein's equation revealed unseen power hiding in mass, U=IxR² suggests that intelligence and iterative feedback loops could reshape reality itself."`

### For Living Glass Effects
Apply to Claude-created elements:
- `.concepts-modal` (lines 27070-27692)
- `.concept-item` — individual cards
- `.evidence-card` — evidence section
- `.idea-card` — ideas grid

### For Evidence Board
Claude's research collected:
- BBC clip: `videos/bbc_clip_3.mp4`
- Experts: Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio
- Page refs: Chapter 1, 4, 8
- 20+ statistics ready

### Performance Notes
- Claude disabled heavy effects on mobile (<768px)
- Particle limit: 400 desktop
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
