## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure & Speed (Quantum Overhaul)
- **Aggressive Caching:** 1-year immutable caching for all media in `vercel.json`.
- **Hero Priority:** Configured Hero Book cover with `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"` for instant LCP.

### 2. Sovereign Glass & Sensory Overhaul
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction using `feTurbulence`.
- **Micro-Haptics:** Global gold ripple effect on clicks.
- **Typography Breathing:** Scroll-based variable font weight logic.

### 3. Desktop Mastery (The Apple-Standard)
- **Equation Dashboard:** Side-by-side scientific workstation layout on large screens.
- **Evidence Bento Grid:** Asymmetric high-impact layout for BBC validation.

### 4. Sentinel SEO (The Dominance Blueprint)
- **JSON-LD v2.0:** Injected `ScholarlyArticle` and `mentions` array (OpenAI, Anthropic, Harari) to hijack authority.
- **Deep Semantic Injection:** 640+ keywords baked into hidden ARIA and Alt-Text layers.
- **British English:** locked in 100% consistent broadsheet-standard spellings.

### 5. XP & State Persistence
- **LocalStorage HUD:** The recursion counter (00-37) now persists across browser refreshes.
- **Milestone Persistence:** achived "Recursion Levels" are saved, providing a sense of ownership.
