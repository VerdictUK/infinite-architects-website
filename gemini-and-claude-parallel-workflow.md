## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
Updated `package.json` to handle local Vercel CLI and modern Node environments.

### 2. Sovereign Glass UI (Implemented Phase 3)
Implemented refractive depth using CSS `backdrop-filter` and SVG turbulence.
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction using `feTurbulence`.
- **Micro-Haptics:** Global gold ripple effect on clicks.
- **Typography Breathing:** Scroll-based variable font weight logic for h1/h2 headings.

### 3. Desktop Mastery (The Apple-Standard)
- **Equation Dashboard:** Converted the Equation section from a vertical stack to a side-by-side dashboard on screens >1024px. The interactive simulator now sits parallel to the explanation for a scientific workstation feel.
- **Evidence Bento Grid:** Implemented an asymmetric bento grid. The primary BBC video card spans 2x2 while secondary evidence cards wrap around it, creating a sophisticated visual hierarchy that commands attention.

### 4. Interaction Physics
- **Wormhole Pull:** Added gravitational force logic to the Three.js loop. Particles are now physically attracted to the user's cursor.
- **Dopamine Milestones:** Progress tracking (0-37) with premium toast notifications.
