## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
Updated `package.json` to handle local Vercel CLI and modern Node environments:
```json
"preview": "npx vercel",
"deploy": "npx vercel --prod",
"serve": "npx serve . -p 3000"
```
*Rationale:* Ensures Apple-grade deployment stability without global permission issues.

### 2. Sovereign Glass UI (Implemented Phase 3)
Implemented refractive depth using CSS `backdrop-filter` and SVG turbulence for high-end optical simulation.
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction using `feTurbulence` and `feDisplacementMap`.
- **Micro-Haptics:** Global gold ripple effect on user clicks triggered via JS and SVG filters.
- **Typography Breathing:** Headings dynamically adjust variable font weights based on viewport scroll position.

### 3. Interactive Eastwood Equation ($U = I \times R^2$)
Three.js module where users manipulate sliders:
- **I (Intelligence):** Controls particle speed and mouse influence density.
- **R (Recursion):** Controls fractal complexity and connection distance.
- **U (Universe):** Triggers a "Creation Point" gold flash when the equation balances (U=1.0).

### 4. Evidence Board & Narrative Grounding
- **Evidence Board:** Integrated `videos/bbc_clip_2.mp4` with custom glass UI controls.
- **Thames Intro:** Swapped Mandelbrot loop for `london-night.mp4` (reversing Thames) for cinematic grounding.
- **Sovereign Proof:** High-contrast verification badges added to all peer-reviewed cards.

### 5. Deep Dive HUD (Cognitive Accessibility)
- **Persistent HUD:** Right-side sidebar with recursion counter (00-37) and progress bar.
- **Z-Axis Transitions:** Sections scale and fade-in using cinematic Z-axis transforms via IntersectionObserver.
- **Grand Council UI:** Added Alignment Score and floating "Council Snippets" to the Religious Integration section.

### 6. Mobile Optimization (The Apple-Standard)
- **Fluid Layouts:** Swapped grid-template-columns for stacked flex on mobile Equation Simulator.
- **Responsive Media:** Optimized Evidence Video Board aspect ratios (4:3) for vertical impact on mobile.
- **Touch-safe UI:** Enlarged slider thumbs and adjusted card spacing for zero-friction navigation.
