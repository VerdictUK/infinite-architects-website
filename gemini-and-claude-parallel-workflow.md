## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure Hardening
Updated `package.json` to handle local Vercel CLI and modern Node environments.

### 2. Sovereign Glass UI (Implemented Phase 3)
Implemented refractive depth using CSS `backdrop-filter` and SVG turbulence.
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction using `feTurbulence`.
- **Micro-Haptics:** Global gold ripple effect on clicks.
- **Typography Breathing:** Scroll-based variable font weight logic for h1/h2 headings.

### 3. Apple-Grade Interaction Physics (Phase 6)
- **Wormhole Pull:** Added gravitational force logic to the Three.js loop. Particles are now physically attracted to the user's cursor.
- **Dopamine Milestones:** Progress tracking (0-37) with premium toast notifications.
- **Full-Width Parity:** Resolved "black bar" issue on large screens and mobile by forcing `100vw` on all background containers (`cosmic-bg`, `mandelbrot-bg`, `future-born-bg`, `paradise-bg`) and applying a global `overflow-x: hidden` guard.

### 4. Interactive Eastwood Equation ($U = I \times R^2$)
Fully functional simulation where users manipulate sliders to see the universe "balance." Triggers gold visual flash when U=1.0.

### 5. Evidence Board & Narrative Grounding
- **Evidence Board:** Integrated BBC Willow clips with custom glass controls.
- **Thames Intro:** Cinematic grounding with night Thames video.
