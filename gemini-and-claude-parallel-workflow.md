## Technical Implementations (Gemini Workflow)

### 1. Infrastructure & Speed (Quantum Overhaul)
- **Aggressive Caching:** Updated `vercel.json` to include 1-year immutable caching for all media (jpg, png, webp, mp4, webm, woff2).
- **Rendering Efficiency:** Implemented `content-visibility: auto` on all major sections to skip rendering of off-screen content.
- **Async Decoding:** Added `decoding="async"` to all non-critical images to prevent main-thread blocking.
- **Hero Priority:** Configured Hero Book cover with `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"` for instant LCP.
- **Speculative Loading:** Added pre-render/preconnect hints for Amazon to speed up the purchase journey.

### 2. Sovereign Glass UI (Implemented Phase 3)
Implemented refractive depth using CSS `backdrop-filter` and SVG turbulence.
- **Living Glass:** Frosting + Distorted refraction using `feTurbulence`.
- **Micro-Haptics:** Global gold ripple effect on clicks.
- **Typography Breathing:** Scroll-based variable font weight logic for h1/h2 headings.

### 3. Desktop Mastery (The Apple-Standard)
- **Equation Dashboard:** Converted the Equation section to a side-by-side dashboard layout.
- **Evidence Bento Grid:** Implemented an asymmetric bento grid for high-density newsroom impact.

### 4. Apple-Grade Interaction Physics
- **Wormhole Pull:** Particles physically attracted to the user's cursor.
- **Dopamine Milestones:** Progress tracking (0-37) with premium toast notifications.
- **Full-Width Parity:** Resolved "black bar" issue by forcing `100vw` on all background containers.
