## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Main Grid:** Keep 9-12 featured concepts (as you have now)
2. **Modal/Page:** "View All 37 Concepts" button opens a dedicated modal or page showing all 37
3. **Each card:** Custom artwork + title + 1-2 sentence description

This prevents overwhelming the homepage while giving dedicated readers the full experience.
